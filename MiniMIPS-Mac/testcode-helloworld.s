# "Hello World" in MIPS assembly
# From: http://labs.cs.upt.ro/labs/so2/html/resources/nachos-doc/mipsf.html

	# All program code is placed after the
	# .text assembler directive
	.text 0x0

# The label 'main' represents the starting point
main:
	# Run the print_string syscall which has code 4
	li	$v0, 4		# Code for syscall: print_string
	la	$a0, msg	# Pointer to string (load the address of msg)
	syscall
	li	$v0, 10		# Code for syscall: exit
	syscall

	# All memory structures are placed after the
	# .data assembler directive
	.data 0x20

	# The .asciiz assembler directive creates
	# an ASCII string in memory terminated by
	# the null character. Note that strings are
	# surrounded by double-quotes
